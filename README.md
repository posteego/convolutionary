# Convolutionary

**This repo is currently archived. It was part of Columbia University's Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp.**

Convolutionary is a website that helps people visualize convolution.

## Inspiration

I was inspired to work on this project when thinking about my engineering courses in the past,
and remembering that many of my peers had a difficult time visualizing the "flip and shift" method and the resulting graph after a convolution.

My goal was to make a site that can take two functions from input,
and create an animation that creates the convolution graph in real time, similar to the animations on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution):
